I am making a new page.  It's called <A HREF="http://www.crosswinds.net/salt-lake-city/~cykadelik"target="_parent">Cykadelik's Lair</A>.  I will have lots of different things on it, but right now there isnt much.  So check it out later and it will hopefully have lots of cool stuff on it soon.  Its going to rule :)

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>1/17/98</FONT><BR>
I decided not to move my page.  Why do it when it's already here.  I am making another page.  It will be even cooler than this one :)

What a way to start the new year!  Okay its been a real long time now, but I know no one looks at this page anymore, so I'm just going to use it to show it off to all of my friends.  HI EVERYONE heheh.  Anyone that isnt my friend and hasn't heard of Ultima Online, dont get it its buggy.  <A HREF="http://baneofchaos.uo.org">Stormrune</A> rocks  (Bane of Chaos...the guild I'm in)  Please only mail me if its interesting or if it has something to do with something cool.  I'm not updating anymore, so please dont ask :)

Man it's been a long long time.  I don't ever update cause I'm busy playing <A HREF="http://www.owo.com">Ultima Online</A>...the damned best game that's ever been made, even though some things are messed up.  If you have a chance, check it out.  You gotta love it.  If you do have it, I play on Great Lakes as Lhianna.  I'm usually in Britain or at the castle Stormrune, just north of Britain. <BR>
I won't be updating anymore.  There is no point.  I don't play Warcraft II.  The war2 downloads will stay.  I won't take my page down because Im proud of it and all the work I've done with it.  I might make a Ultima Online page.  If I do, I'll post it here.  I may put UO (Ultima Online) news here. If you want, email me if you have UO, and that would be cool.  seeya

w00w00!  I got a new monitor.  finally.  its pretty nice.  I kinda have a problem with the voting thing.  i had to get a new netscape so all my folders for netscape mail were lost, which means all of the stuff for the awards are gone.  I'm going to fix the link to the submit button to make it send to my hotmail address so that I won't lose anything anymore.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/23/97</FONT><BR>
My monitor is starting to work better.  I added a signing to the guestbook.  It's the end of the term for school...yay. only 3 more boring stupid terms of school left.  vote for your favorite war2 page!!!  =) 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/21/97</FONT><BR>
suck suck suck suck suck.  You know what sucks?  My stupid computer.  Actually its my monitor.  Its all messed up so it turns off every 5 minutes and doesn't come back on for another 20.  So it makes it real hard to do anything.  Hopefully I will be getting a new monitor soon.  

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/17/97</FONT><BR>
New Version of Kali is out!  Get it on my 'Downloads' page.  I added a new link to Alchemist.  Check his page out.  Remember to Vote!
 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/16/97</FONT><BR>
My computer is finally fixed, but my email is all screwed up.  I've added a new water strategy, added by Dreek from <A HREF="http://w1.605.telia.com/~u60502112/war2/">Warcraft.Net</A><BR>  I've also gotten some votes for Best Warcraft Page.  I am thinking of having all of the sites that are voted for up til the end of October, to be in a final vote.  So I would have 2 times you would need to vote.  I really hope all of that makes sense =) Please give me some suggestions or tell me that it's a good idea =)  Thank You!

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/10/97</FONT><BR>
Hey I won't be able to update for a while because my computer is being fixed.  Please be patient while you wait =)  thanks.  Don't forget to vote for your favorite Warcraft page!!

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=1>10/3/97</FONT><BR>
I made another new page.  This one is for the best Warcraft page out there.  Everyone that wants to will vote for their favorite page and give a comment on it.  This way it won't be just my opinion, but everyone's.  I need your help, so please fill out the form.  I also need suggestions for it to make it better...please help!

I didn't do too much today.  I just fixed a few of the banners that werent working.  I also went down the list of Downloads to make sure they all worked.  The only one that didn't seem to be working was the Warcraft II Alpha.  I've noticed that it doesn't work sometimes but then works again.  So it should (hopefully) start working soon.
<BR>

I made a new page.  Its called Ranks.  It has the ranks and scores from when you win (or lose) in a game.  Its kinda nice to see how well you did =)  I also re-did my 'Cheats' page cause it looked kinda dumb before.  I made 2 new new banners that are my 'My Banners' page.  Go look at them =)
