In a water level, you must build land units.  Without land units, theres no way to win (unless: you use dragons, or the enemy gives up).  This is the order I build things:
<BR>
TH<BR> Farm<BR>
 Lumber Mill (peon repair it)<BR>
 Shipyard (2 peons repairing it)<BR>
 Foundry (2 peons repairing it)<BR> 
Farm<BR> 
Barracks...<BR> 
A real important key in winning the game is getting your shipyard up fast, getting a foundry up and building JUGGS, not Destroyers!  Once you have your shipyard, build a tanker then make an oil platform. Make 
another tanker and use it to scout.  If you find the enemy and they dont have a platform up, build one over the patch!! =) that will screw them up and defend it cause they will try to take it down.  Be sure to be making land units 
and upgrading.  Make transports...when you transport guys over to another island, do not let them just sit there, you have to act fast or the enemy will sink the transport taking your 
units with it.  Also, when you are transporting guys, don't put them in the transports until you are ready to send them over, but put them near the transport so its more convenient. <BR><BR><HR>

If you think your enemys have too many Battleships
and would like to destroy them without spending any
gold, lumber or oil, all you have to do is to create
a Eye of Kilrogg and place it over a Battleship there
are at least one Elven Destroyer nearby. The Elven 
Destroyer will shoot at the Eye of Kilrogg. It will
also hit the Battleship as your Kilrogg will try to
escape. Since there are no Stand Ground at them, you
will have to place them over the Battleship manually
ï¿½til the ship is destroyed. Do this a couple of times
and attack them when you think it is enough. This 
will result in a decrease in the enemys naval defense.
