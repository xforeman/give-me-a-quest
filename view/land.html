This strategy is for human most... Build two barracks a
bit from your town. Pump out first footmen and archers
and put them in a line with footmen first and archers
behind. Meanwhile, upgrade as much as you can and start
to build knights. Move the footmens and put the knights
there. You could also build some ballistas for back-up.
When it�s done, send over your footmen to disturb their
defense. Some of them will for sure die as they think 
you�re stupid to attack with only a few footmens. They
will probably attack you with their full army, thinking
you won�t have anyone left... But you have!!! If you are
smart, you have a HUGE army waiting for them... It�s always
good with some mages that can polymorph and do blizzards.
When they are dead, their town is almost unguarded... ;)

A good way to find out if an enemy is coming or where they are going, before you have Fliers, is to use farms.  After you know where your enemy is, put
farms on the path to their base so you can see them coming.  They may find other ways to get to your base, so try every path possible.  <CENTER><BR><A HREF="#top">Top</A><br></CENTER>

Grunt Rushing is <B>Building Barracks First</B>.  Grunt Rushing is NOT just attacking with grunts early. You can't do this on low res.  Just remember that!  Its also a cheap trick that
that doesn't prove you are any good.
