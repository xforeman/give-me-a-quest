If you use cheats and still would like to see your rank,
just save the game before you win the scenarion and load
it again. You will win the scenario and still havent used
a single cheat. The game is created NOT to save any cheat
saving a game. You will be able to see your rank as no 
cheats are used. This could be quite effective if you want
to prove that you are "warchief" or something "without"
using any cheats. Itï¿½s still better and funnier with no cheats.

Build a cannon tower in your base by your mine early in the game.  Then build another cannon tower in range of the other so that
when the enemy comes to attack your peons, your cannon towers can defend them.  If they attack one cannon tower, the other cannon tower can defend it.  <BR>
Unless they split up their guys (some attacking one tower, and some attack the other) it should work pretty well.  <CENTER><BR><A HREF="#top">Top</A><br></CENTER>

<A NAME="lumberbug"><FONT SIZE=4><LI>Lumber Bug</FONT><BR>
The lumber bug is very important when playing a low resources game.  How to do it:<BR>
Click on trees before making: Town Hall, Lumber Mill<BR>
Then build TH or LM.  You don't have to start chopping the trees for it to work, just harvest or right click on the trees.<BR>
What it does:  It gives you 100 lumber when you make either a TH or LM.<CENTER><BR><A HREF="#top">Top</A><br></CENTER>

This isnt repairing when your building is about to be destroyed (although, thats a good idea!).  A good idea is to repair your barracks on a land level while it is being built.  Buildings that
need to be built up fast (like a barracks, lumber mill, shipyard, etc...) should be repaired while being built.<CENTER><BR><A HREF="#top">Top</A><br></CENTER>

<A NAME="2manytowers"><FONT SIZE=4><LI>Too many enemy Towers</FONT><BR>
If there are too many towers and sappers cant get through, just make 
some catapults.  Just make sure you defend them cause they take a looong time
to make.  <CENTER><BR><A HREF="#top">Top</A><br></CENTER>
